<h1 align="left"> About the Project </h1>

This repository contains the backend of a system developed to optimize the management of In Vitro Embryo Production (PIVE) in cattle. The goal is to replace manual spreadsheets with a centralized digital solution, allowing precise tracking of all stages, from oocyte collection to embryo transfer and pregnancy management.

The backend was built with Java and Spring Boot, using a RESTful API documented with Swagger to ensure easy integration and maintenance. The system was field-tested, proving its effectiveness compared to the manual method.

This project has been selected to participate in MOSTRATEC, the largest science and technology fair in Latin America.
